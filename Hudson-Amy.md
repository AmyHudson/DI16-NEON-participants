#### Domain of Interest
I am interested in testing the spatiotemporal stationarity of
vegetation-climate interactions. Climate + Paleo Climate + Phenology  
#### A Goal for the course
Explore the NEON datasets to determine those that can be used to capture vegetation phenophases.

## Capstone Project
Determine how phenology datasets differ between NEON's 20 ecoregions- specifically how elevation may be impacting elevation.
#### Datasets for Project
Observational phenology dataset
